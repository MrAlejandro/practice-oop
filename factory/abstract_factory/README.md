# Abstract Factory
## Definition
The **Abstract Factory** pattern, provides interface to create family of related or dependent objects without specifying their names.

### Notes
1. The pattern is based on composition, rather than inheritance like for `factory method`
2. Useful when you want to create a family of products, when you have to provide logical coherence of objects you creating.
