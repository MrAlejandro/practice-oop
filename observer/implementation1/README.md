## Definition
The **Observer** pattern defined as "one-to-many" relationships between objects, such that when the state of one object (Subject) changes, other objects (Observers) are automatically notified.

### Questions
1. Think of the update logic for Observer, what to pass to this method, or maybe the Observer should get the desired data by itself, by calling Objects methods, or Subject might return another data object.
